# My WCF Project

This project is a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application that provides a service for clients to interact with. 

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the WCF service.
  - **Services/**: Contains the service implementation.
    - `MyService.svc`: Defines the WCF service endpoint and behavior.
  - **Interfaces/**: Contains the service contract.
    - `IMyService.cs`: Exports the interface that defines the service methods.
  - **Models/**: Contains the data model used by the service.
    - `MyModel.cs`: Represents the data structure used in the service.
  - `Program.cs`: The entry point of the application that configures and starts the WCF service host.
  
- `my-wcf-project.csproj`: The project file that contains configuration settings and dependencies for the WCF application.

## Getting Started

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary .NET SDK installed. You can build and run the project using the following commands:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Usage

Once the service is running, you can interact with it using a WCF client. Make sure to reference the service endpoint defined in `MyService.svc`.
